<h2>Who am I ?</h2>
<p>Hi ! my name is <a href="mailto:nicolas.fauchereau@gmail.com">Nicolas Fauchereau</a>
I am a climate scientist at <a href="http://www.niwa.co.nz">NIWA</a> and I am based in Auckland, New Zealand.</p>
<p>I work on a variety of things, from the reconstruction of the climates of the past
to seasonal forecasting. I have a strong interest in methods (statistics, machine learning particularly),
in scientific computing and open science. </p>
<h2>Where do I come from ?</h2>
<p>I hail from Burgundy, France, and I obtained my Ph.D in Dijon. After about a year
at the LSCE, near Paris, I decided to expand a bit my horizons. I was granted a post-doctoral
fellowship from the University of Cape-Town, and I spent about 3 years working at the
oceanography department (where I am still a research associate). In 2009 I joined
the CSIR as a senior researcher in the Southern Observatory (SOCCO) where I had the
great privilege of working with a bunch of awesome people.</p>
<p>In 2012 we decided to relocate our little family to New Zealand, after I obtained
a position at the National Institute for Water and Atmospheric research (NIWA Ltd.).  </p>
<h2>Tools</h2>
<p>I use <a href="http://www.python.org">Python</a> and of course the Python Scientific ecosystem,
in particular, this is what I use (almost) daily:</p>
<ul>
<li>numpy</li>
<li>scipy</li>
<li>matplotlib</li>
<li>pandas</li>
<li>basemap</li>
<li>scikit-learn</li>
<li>xray</li>
</ul>
<p>and of course the [IPython (now Jupyter)] notebook</p>
