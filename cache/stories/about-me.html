<h2>Who am I ?</h2>
<p>Hi ! my name is <a href="mailto:nicolas.fauchereau@gmail.com">Nicolas Fauchereau</a>
I am a climate scientist at <a href="http://www.niwa.co.nz">NIWA</a> and I am based in Auckland, New Zealand.</p>
<p>I work on a variety of things, from the reconstruction of the climates of the past
to seasonal forecasting. I have a strong interest in methods (statistics, machine learning particularly),
in scientific computing and open science.</p>
<h2>Where do I come from ?</h2>
<p>I hail from Burgundy, France, and I obtained my Ph.D (in 2004) in <a href="http://climatologie.u-bourgogne.fr/">Dijon</a>. After about a year
at the <a href="http://www.lsce.ipsl.fr/en/">LSCE</a>, near Paris, I decided to expand a bit my horizons. I was granted a post-doctoral
fellowship from the <a href="http://www.uct.ac.za/">University of Cape-Town</a>, and I spent about 3 years working at the
<a href="http://www.sea.uct.ac.za/">oceanography department</a> (where I am still a research associate), notably with
<a href="http://ma-re.uct.ac.za/staff/academic-staff/dr-mathieu-rouault/">Prof. Mathieu Rouault</a>, another french import in South Africa and one of the most
versatile scientists I have known. In 2009 I joined
the <a href="http://www.csir.co.za/">CSIR</a> as a senior researcher in the Southern Ocean Carbon and Climate Observatory (<a href="http://socco.org.za/about/">SOCCO</a>) where I had the
great privilege of working with a <a href="http://socco.org.za/about/#team">bunch of awesome people</a>.  </p>
<p><br></p>
<p>In 2012 we decided to relocate our little family to New Zealand, and I obtained
a position at the <a href="http://www.niwa.co.nz">National Institute for Water and Atmospheric research (NIWA Ltd.)</a>.  </p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Since joining NIWA, I have been working on a variety of projects, and been involved in both
basic research (<em>e.g.</em> paleoclimate reconstructions) and very applied science (<em>e.g.</em> forecasting climate at sub-seasonal
to seasonal time-scales). A common theme though: all this involves processing and analyzing data - oftentimes a lot of data - and using statistical methods to
try and make sense of this data, extract patterns, and make predictions. Along the years I used various tools, from Matlab to R, but since a few years I transitioned completely to Python: the Python Scientific Ecosystem has grown exponentially both in quality and quantity, and now there's almost nothing that you can do in R or Matlab
that you cannot do in Python, and on top of being open-source, <a href="https://xkcd.com/353/">Python is just fun to code</a>.</p>
<h2>Tools</h2>
<p>I use <a href="http://www.python.org">Python</a> and of course the Python Scientific ecosystem,
in particular, this is what I use (almost) daily:  </p>
<ul>
<li>numpy</li>
<li>scipy</li>
<li>matplotlib</li>
<li>pandas</li>
<li>basemap</li>
<li>scikit-learn</li>
<li>xray</li>
</ul>
<p>and of course the [IPython (now Jupyter)] notebook.</p>
