<p>I am a climate scientist (to know more about me, head <a href="http://nicolasfauchereau.github.io/climatecode/stories/about-me/">here</a>) and have been using
<a href="http://www.python.org">Python</a> as my main high-level language for data analysis
and visualisation for about 10 years, slowly transitioning from Matlab and R.</p>
<p>In this blog, I will try and share what's I have learned along the way, and give
full examples of how I use Python in my research or operational workflows.  </p>
<p>I will occasionally reflect on <a href="http://openscience.com">open science</a>, and how open-source in general,
and Python in particular can be used to help make climate science more open.  </p>
