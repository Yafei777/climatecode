## Who am I ?

Hi ! my name is [Nicolas Fauchereau](mailto:nicolas.fauchereau@gmail.com)
I am a climate scientist at [NIWA](http://www.niwa.co.nz) and I am based in Auckland, New Zealand.

I work on a variety of things, from the reconstruction of the climates of the past
to seasonal forecasting. I have a strong interest in methods (statistics, machine learning particularly),
in scientific computing and open science. 

## Where do I come from ?

I hail from Burgundy, France, and I obtained my Ph.D in Dijon. After about a year
at the LSCE, near Paris, I decided to expand a bit my horizons. I was granted a post-doctoral
fellowship from the University of Cape-Town, and I spent about 3 years working at the
oceanography department (where I am still a research associate). In 2009 I joined
the CSIR as a senior researcher in the Southern Observatory (SOCCO) where I had the
great privilege of working with a bunch of awesome people.

In 2012 we decided to relocate our little family to New Zealand, after I obtained
a position at the National Institute for Water and Atmospheric research (NIWA Ltd.).  

## Tools

I use [Python](http://www.python.org) and of course the Python Scientific ecosystem,
in particular, this is what I use (almost) daily:

+ numpy
+ scipy
+ matplotlib
+ pandas
+ basemap
+ scikit-learn
+ xray

and of course the [IPython (now Jupyter)] notebook
